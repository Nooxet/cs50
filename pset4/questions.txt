    BMP: 24-bit, 32-bit with alpha channel.
    GIF: 8-bit
    JPEG: 24-bit
    PNG: 48-bit

1.  Only GIF supports animation.

2.  Lossless compression means that all the information will be
    recovered during decompression.
    Lossy is the opposite - One can not recover all the information
    after decompression.

3.  JPEG is lossy-compressed.

4.  It basically just removes the pointer to the the data (first cluster of it)
    but the actual data is still there.

5.  Actually overwrite the all the blocks with e.g. NULL bytes.

6.  The header file in which uint8_t uint16_t etc. are defined.

7.  To make sure the variables are of a specific size e.g. uint8_t is exactly 8 bits wide and is only positive.

8.  
    BYTE: 1 byte    (unsigned)
    DWORD: 4 bytes  (unsigned)
    LONG: 4 bytes   (signed)
    WORD: 2 bytes   (unsigned)

9.  0x42 0x4D (BM)

10. 
    bfSize: size of bitmap file in bytes.
    biSize: the number of byte required by the BITMAPINFOHEADER struct.

11. if biHeight is < 0, it means that the bmp is a top-down DIB and the origin
    is the upper-left corner.

12. biBitCount

13. We might me out of memory, thus we can not create a new file.

14. Since we always read one structure at a time. We specify the size of the structure to be read,
    then reads one number of said structure.

15. 3

16. fseek sets the file position indicator to a new position by adding
    an offset to a position specified by the parameter "whence".

17. SEEK_CUR specifies the current position indicator when calling fseek.
